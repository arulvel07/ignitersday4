# **WEB DEVELOPMENT HACKATHON**
## IGNITERS HACKATHON 2025 | DAY 4/20
**Topic sentence:-** 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐚 𝐓𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐚𝐛 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 — a tool that could shape smarter infrastructure for the tech space on campus.

##  Overview
### Tinker lab system
The system includes:
- A home page to simulate login as **student** or **admin**
- A **slot booking form** for students
- An **admin dashboard** to view bookings and check-in status (static for now)


This is a pure **HTML + CSS** project focused on UI and concept demonstration.

## Webpages
 `index.html`-  Home page with “Login as Student” / “Login as Admin”

 `student.html`- Booking form (name, date, time slot) 

 `admin.html` - Static table of bookings and check-in status 

## StyleSheet
 `style.css` - Styling for all pages (minimal) 


## Progess
    - Added the structure of all the webpages using only html
    - designed them with css (format/colours/animations/videos/photos)
    - Only front is developed, since im not familiar with backend at this 
    - Organised college logo and video in a seperate folder named '/Assets'


## Folder Structure
```
.
├── index.html
├── student.html
├── admin.html
├── style.css
└── assets/
    ├── logo.png
    └── video.mp4
```
